STEAMWare ( Science - Technology - Engineering - Art - Mathematics ) - Ware




*Note from the author*

This is an extremely potent technology. Ill leave it at that. Built it for kids, adults and robots. I want it simple and I want it free and I want to reinvest the value of this tech into itself and the benefits go to us all. Be a builder. DO with these what YOU want. 





What is STEAMWare?
==================

In short, STEAMWare refers to a new (LEGO-like) modular part family and the open-source software utility which generates them.

Each Call creates an .scad file, .stl file and a a .png file of the same filename.



OpenSource
==========

Pull requests are appreciated. But bear with me I am slow fucking molasis most days. 

*Benefits*

- Not limited to 3D printers but illuminated by them.
- STEAMWare is material independent and hyper non-propietary.
- STEAMWare is far cheaper than anything like it and far more useful.
- Utility and recreation grade.
- Hyper modular
- Infinite Parts
- Illegal operations
- Inventions Wanted
- Developers Wanted
- Believers Wanted

    Replace physical parts with files for print/reference.
    Replace Legos with STEAMWare
    Replace propietary with permissive open source
    Replace finite parts with infinite parts.



Binding
=======

Fit and Join:

Bolt and Nut

Wrap Binding

Friction Binding

On Padding Variance:




Manufacturing
=============

Principly these were built with 3D printers in mind: This is multifold First 


1.) 3D printers cannot compete with traditional manufdactuinr meathods true 

however this is only the case for a subset of all possible design sets which STEAMWare now provides access to. F
rom this viewpoint CNC machnines onyl are better for certsain parts.

2.) 3D Printers are getting way better.

3.) Abstrracted from materials or manufacturing process.
