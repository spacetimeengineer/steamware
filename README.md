*Note from the author*

This is a powerful technology but you should see for yourself. I didnt want to complicate this product. I wanted it simple and I wanted it free so the benifits go to you first. Get dangerous. 


*Benefits*

- Not limited to 3D printers but illuminated by them.
- STEAMWare is material independent and hyper non-propietary.
- STEAMWare is far cheaper than anything like it and far more useful.
- Utility and recreation grade.
- Hyper modular
- Infinite Parts
- No Illegal operations
