I didnt want to complicate this product. I wanted it free and simple. I believe this is what will give it power.

What

STEAMWare makes reference to physical STEAMWare and the STEAMWare.py file that produces it.



    $ STEAMWare.py --basis_unit = 10 --padding = 0.134

    $ STEAMWare.py --basis_unit = 10 --padding = 0.134 XXX

    $ STEAMWare.py --basis_unit = 10 --padding = 0.134 XXXZ

    $ STEAMWare.py --basis_unit = 10 --padding = 0.134 XXXZCXX

    $ STEAMWare.py --basis_unit = 10 --padding = 0.134 XXYYAABBX
